Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence is composed of two words; artificial and intelligence. When asked, "What is Artificial Intelligence?", We need to open these two words and examine them. That's the point. The point where "Artificial Intelligence" is wrongly named.
Actually, the name Artificial Intelligence is true, but in recent years the name has been used for every algorithm (anyone who knows or does not know). Everyone started to give Artificial Intelligence tags to a product they made but these are actually nothing more than the applied algorithm. We produce the products that we produce so that we can make our lives easier, and this already replaces the human being at one point. Ultimately it would not make sense to call it artificial intelligence, so if a task comes up with power, it must be called a machine. In the same way, if a product that we created does calculations and analysis in our stead, it should be called applied algorithm. 
Yes, now we can examine artificial and intelligence words. Let's start with intelligence. Intelligence is all about the ability of a person to think, reasoning, to perceive objective facts, understand, judge (most important), and draw conclusions. You will understand why The word "Artificial" precedes the word "Intelligence" because it will make these abilities a product. And the meaning of the Artificial word is "man-made by being likened to something". While intelligence is all that we have mentioned above, It is called with artificial " this is the ability of all made by analogy".
